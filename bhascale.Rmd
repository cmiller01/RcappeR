The **bhascale** dataset contains data for the lengths per second scale used by the BHA ([source](http://www.britishhorseracing.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Lengths-Per-Second-Scale-Tables.pdf)) when determining the margins beaten.  This dataset is called by the [bha_ls](bha_ls.html) function when converting margins between horses from lengths back into seconds.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(RcappeR)
```

```{r}
data(bhascale)
```

The dataset has `r dim(bhascale)[1]` rows and `r dim(bhascale)[2]` columns.
